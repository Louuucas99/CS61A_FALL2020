Alfonso will only wear a jacket outside if it is below 60 degrees or it is raining.
Write a function that takes in the current temperature and a boolean value telling
if it is raining and returns True if Alfonso will wear a jacket and False otherwise

Tutorial: Write a function that returns True if a positive integer n is a prime
number and False otherwise.

A prime number n is a number that is not divisible by any numbers other than 1
and n itself. For example, 13 is prime, since it is only divisible by 1 and 13, but 14
is not, since it is divisible by 1, 2, 7, and 14.

Hint: use the % operator: x % y returns the remainder of x when divided by y.
